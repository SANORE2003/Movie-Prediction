Movie Rating Prediction Project

Overview
This project aims to develop a movie rating prediction system using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Key aspects include:

Non-Negative Matrix Factorization is an intelligent data analysis technique that transforms complex, large-scale data into simpler, more interpretable components. Imagine it as a sophisticated detective that breaks down a massive puzzle (your movie ratings) into smaller, more manageable pieces.
In our movie recommendation system, NMF acts like a behind-the-scenes translator that converts complicated user-movie interactions into meaningful patterns. Instead of treating ratings as random numbers, it discovers hidden connections and preferences.

Key Aspects

1.NMF Creation(ML Model)
2.Model Development & Persistence
3.Frontend Development and Backend Development
4.Docker Containerization Strategy
5.CI/CD with GitHub Actions
6.Prometheus Monitoring
